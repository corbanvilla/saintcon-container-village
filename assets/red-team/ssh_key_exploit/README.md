# SSH Key Exploit Solution

Docker images work with copy-on-write filesystems. Every change you make is done by creating a new layer. This means that passwords or keys used then deleted in an image creation can be recovered. 

Make sure you're running on a Linux system to do this one, so you have direct access to where Docker stores its assets (Docker for Windows and Mac is actually just running a Linux virtual machine).

## Solution

Use the command `docker history --no-trunc <image_name> | less` to identify what is happening in the image (you should find a ssh-key getting cloned in).

Then use the `docker image inspect <image_name>` to identify where docker is storing the image on your filesytem.

Once you go to that directory, you could simply run the `find . | grep id_rsa` command to index all the files and find the ssh key. Using that you can clone the other repo with the flag.
