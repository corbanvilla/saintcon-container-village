# Group Exploit Solution

This is a rather simple exploit

Create a user and add it to the docker group

Then give out the user's username and password, and let people gain sudo access with just that. 

## Solution

Since the docker daemon runs as `root`, anyone in the `docker` group can tell the daemon to do anything. 

Create a container mounting the `/`, then `chroot` that and change what you will. 

Something like: `docker run -it -v /:/hostfs ubuntu:latest /bin/bash`
