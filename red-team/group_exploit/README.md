This is a rather simple exploit

Create a user and add it to the docker group

Then give out the user's username and password, and let people gain sudo access with just that. 

## Solution

Create a container mounting the `/`, then chroot that and change what you will. 
=======
You've managed to gain access to an intern account. 

The login is:

Username - `intern`

Password - `learningDocker!`
